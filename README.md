Submitted by: Patrick Duffany

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

I had to create a VM in order to run XCode on my Windows Desktop, so the integration between the two was not as seemless as I would have liked it to be. Still working on getting used to Mac.
